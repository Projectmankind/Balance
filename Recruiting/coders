We need people that would like to help building a new system.

U need to be able to think outside of the box.....
Where the current leaders are bound by "border" restrictions, we are not!

This means u will code for humanity and not for a small group of people.

Whoever is willing to help this project, his/her name will be bounded as someone who stands at the beginning and helped shaping this new evolution.

So if u really wanna make a difference in this world then come help us reshape this world into something we all feel like we are at home!

For the coding part we need a system that can be most likely compared to a finance system.

The current finance systems of the world need to be replaced by something more humane!
Something that cannot be altered by people themselves in other words we need to get rid of the supply and demand rules we currently use.
Instead we need to create a rewarding sytem that looks a bit more like what is being used in games nowadays.
Everyone should get a base and everyone should have the same changes on getting extra's.
Nobody should own anyhing since everything will be ours!

More discussion on these matters will be done by those involved, and will probably be done in public chats or similar and is open for everyone as long as they behave off course.

If interested u can contact us at Projectmankind.25.12.2021@gmail.com.
