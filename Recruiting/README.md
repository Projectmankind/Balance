We will need all the help we can get!

To build a new system for mankind where we choose what is best for us instead of how a single entity can make as much profit as possible.

That is the mindset we are looking for and the only requirement for joining this project that is in my eyes the only way to save our existence.

In my eyes:
Mankind has come to a point where we are capable of reshapping the entire system into something to be proud of to pass onto the children of this world!

Why is the current system bad and will eventually destroy more then u want it to!
The current system is based on whoever pays the most..... not on what is the best for everyone!
Every descission that is being made is based on the cost and the potential profit, even when it means that one persons profit will put a burden on all the other humans.

That needs to change!
Profit should never win from what is best for us all!

It's nothing more then a state of mind.

So who are u? and what do u want? u wanna screw over your fellow humans to make a profit? or do u wanna work together and create heaven on earth?
