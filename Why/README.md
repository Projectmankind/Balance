All my life i have been creating things in my head and in real life.

Every time i ran into the same problems...

When u create a solution to an existing problem u need somekind of approval from money otherwise the chance of failing is huge.

In my eyes a system should take care of everything and should not close it eyes when it exceeds the borders or when there is no funding.
The problems we are facing are global and cannot be solved by small groups even when they are trying to work together.....
Those groups all seem to have their own agenda and are not working together to make a better world for everyone.

So what's the biggest obstacle in this matter? All the small groups with their own agendas.

So the only way to solve that is to create a new system for everyone on this planet where everyone will benefit from all the successes we get.
This means that everyone has the same oppertunities and where we can actually create heavon on this planet for future generations.

Don't let future generations become slaves of the current powers and systems, let them become free and create a better world.

Unite and work on this (or any similar) project before it's actually to late!


P.s.

I'm the kind of person who doesn't like to be in the spotlight, this means...

* I won't respond on any questions that have nothing todo with this project
* I don't do interviews (unless they are with current world leaders, hahaha)
* I don't accept money for this project
* In other words (leave me alone)
