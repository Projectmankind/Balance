So we need 1 system for all life on this planet.

Right now we have many different countries that all use their own systems to supress their inhabitants one way or the other.

Every country in excistance right now is uncapable to solve the real world problems since they run people that are given certain powers that allow those people to use their powers for their own benefits. (one very good and widely accepted example is the paycheck those people receive compared to the paychecks of the people who are actually doing the work.

Wherever their is power their is abuse, so we need a system that holds all the power and that system needs tobe created in a way so it cannot be used to benefit a person or a group of persons.

An example how this could change the real world is the following.

Currently the "Plastic Soup" is a big problem in the world that is created by power....

Plastic is a waste product from oil, and since they didn't know where to put all that plastic waste they created throw away products from it so it wouldn't cost them money but they would even make more on the waste.
If a global system would be in a place instead of all the different regimes. We could have decided together on the whole plastic thing.
But what are we doing now, those companies are still making throw away plastic items and more and more garbage is created with that.
If we would decide together we could have decided that plastic is not something we wanna use for throw away stuff. Hence it would not be created anymore for a long time...

But what do we see in the real world...... It's still being made since money/power from certain people still decides what is allowed and what not.

So let's get rid of the fact that a person or a single group of people have powers that can effect other life or this earth.

In my opinion it's evolve or die, since their is no other outcome anymore
