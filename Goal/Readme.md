The ultimate goals

* Delete all unnecessary jobs (which basicly means that we have a lot less work which in return gives us way more free time to enjoy).
* Remove the power from individuals and give all the power back to the people.
* Unite the people of this world and start working with eachother instead of against eachother.
* Lower our numbers (less people means shortage will be turned into enough for everyone)
* Better rewarding system where chances are not created by individuals but by the people and everyone has the same chance.
* Every child has the same options and oppertunities in life.
* Work for making this world a better place instead of enriching yourself and hurting others while doing so!!!!!

When we all work for a better world and life we can take down all the challenges the world is facing right now (Corona, poverty, shortage, environmental problems, etc)
These problems cannot be solved in the current system....

* Differences on howmuch someone is worth or isn't is getting worse (this brings hate and all other problems that come along with this).
* Corona cannot be solved by individual governments each with their own ruleset.
* We cannot stop our explosive growth as long as we not act as one.
* We cannot stop the environmental problems as long as we not act as one.

So how can we proceed and what do we need todo first?

We need to unite, join or create new political parties and insert these ideas per country untill they are rdy to be dismanteld and become land of us all (no more countries being owned by certain people)!
Only united we can change the world and solve it's problems and make it a better place for everyone.

In my opinion we are better off without the people who are against this instead of trying to convince them, everybody should be wanting this by their own free will.
For those who don't want this start telling your close ones that u are here for yourself only and u don't care about others.
We will put your name on the Wall of Shame (just kidding, but u get the point)!

We can do so much better then what we do now! (so stop being a slave of the current system en fight for the freedom of us all).
